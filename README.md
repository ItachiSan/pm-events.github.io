# PMEX events

A Vue.js version of [pm-events.github.io](https://github.com/pm-events/pm-events.github.io).

## Add new events / announcements
Create your own fork and add the relevant information in the proper JSON file within the `public`
folder, then create a pull request.

The resources do already all the filtering, so no additional cleanup is required in the JSONs.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
